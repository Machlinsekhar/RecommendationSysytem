Dipender ray,"During our stay at Taj Krishna, we enjoyed the breakfast and dinner buffet at the hotel's restaurant. The buffet featured a variety of Indian and Continental dishes, although we noticed that the menu mostly consisted of Indian cuisine. The selection of food was average, and to be honest, the taste didn't quite meet the high standards we expected from Taj. Having visited many Taj hotels in the past, we felt that the food here was lacking in flavor.

While the breakfast was satisfactory, our overall dining experience was just okay.",3.0,,1
Akash Gandikota,"If taste is a priority whenever you step outside for a meal, this restaurant would rank as one of Hyderabad’s worst. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a quiet, music free evening in a luxurious and upmarket setting, this restaurant would be a good choice. It’s that simple. You’ll spend around 2500 + taxes for the buffet. The Andhra Tawa fish starter had that pungent raw fish taste to it, badly disguised with over-masala-fied batter. The aalu tikki, quite honestly scared me. The taste reminded me of plastic and chemicals- that’s how inorganic it was to my taste buds- and no, I’m not exaggerating. The onion rings weren’t thick enough or deep fried enough- I suppose that’s not exactly a bad thing. The chicken kebab was the highlight of the evening and perhaps the only thing on the menu that had any recognisable taste and culinary finesse. In total there were exactly 2 veg and 2 non veg starters. The younger ones wanted something else and we had to order French fries and paneer tikka separately- both of which tasted fine, except for the fact that they were bland and tasteless. I mean, the French fries lacked salt. Next comes the main course, the biryani literally had no flavour. However, the veg papad curry tasted great. The chicken curry tasted kinda okay- but the gravy had this weird translucent look to it. The mutton curry tasted like no other mutton curry I’ve ever tasted anywhere else- and not in a good way. However, it was extremely well cooked- now whether that’s something the restaurant should take credit for or if it’s the always on electric plate- you decide. The hummus was either not fresh, or was cut with something else - it was tasteless and bad tasting at the same time. The Tandoori rotis were great though- thank heavens for that! The 5 spiced noodles tasted okay but were cold & hard. I waited and returned multiple times to check whether it was restocked - but no. The fish salad was quite decent. Let’s move onto the desserts. The ultra sweet banana cobbler had no taste of banana in it. The chocolate and mango cake were again, oversweet with sugar overpowering any flavour. There was an entire section of swirled cream in cups with little things on it to mark different flavours- again, tasteless. However, the litchee crème brûlée actually tasted quite nice and was the only one that won’t send your blood sugar levels into panic mode. This maybe a scathing review but it’s an honest one; to this restaurant’s credit, atleast I didn’t have a ruined stomach the night of, or the next day, which is actually quite an achievement considering everything. A 5 star hotel does not mean a 5 star restaurant or 5 star food. This was one of the worst dining experiences I’ve had in ages. Anyway,if great food in a luxury hotel is what you’re looking for, try ITC Kakatiya.",1.0,,1
Steve Bintley,"You certainly can’t say it isn’t a nice setting for an evening meal, with great tables inside and a truly relaxing environment outside with the water features and pleasant canopies. The staff are all super friendly while remaining professional and proactive with the service. Space at the tables was great with them being large and spacious plus everything was spotlessly clean throughout.

The choice at the buffet inside was really good with all the dishes kept topped up and fresh and great flavours across the board. From side dishes, main items and deserts there was a full range which should satisfy most people and gave plenty of reasons to return for additional courses.

While a buffet dinner might not always strike as a high end affair, this is certainly different and one which was truly enjoyable and I’d recommend even for a special occasion.",5.0,,1
Aabhaas Walia,"The in-house restaurant Encounter offers sumptuous breakfast treats. Even though the items in the menu are limited, if you are loquacious enough you can chat up with staff, who is always ready to offer items unmentioned in the menu. For instance, a pizza, a pasta, fresh juices and shakes . So you can chart your very own gastronomical romance if you are a little venturesome.
They have both indoor as well outdoor seating. Place is tastefully designed and comfortable.
The staff is confident and very interactive and displays good hospitality skills.
I enjoyed the buffet with beautiful antiqueish interior artefacts and nice outside pool view.",5.0,,1
uttam reddy,"Visited this place for lunch on my birthday. The place was super packed while we reached there. Soup was mediocre. Coming  to starters, chicken was not great, although fish was good and loved the papad panner which was crispy and super tasty and followed by some Chinese which were decent too. Main course was also fine with the breads served on table followed by some biryani which went well too. Loved their desserts as it had my favorite double ka meetha follower my many varieties which had chocolate mousse, Rasmalai and few more.

arish020,"Excellent spread for a breakfast buffet.

If the weather isn’t too warm, the outside seating is a great choice. The pool and fountains add to the comforting ambience with a soft sound of trickling water. If the weather is warm, stay indoors and enjoy the air conditioning. :)

There are live counters for omelettes, dosas, puri, waffles, pancakes, etc.

Seating is comfortable with the cane chairs having tall armrests.

On the whole, would recommend 10/10.",5.0,,1

Nandini Mathur,"Taj Krishna is definitely at the top in the list of restaurants that I would prefer any time. I visited the Encounters Restaurant in Taj Krishna a couple of days ago, with my family. We went there for a Sunday brunch and they satisfied us just as usual. They had ample of options to choose from in their buffet spread. We  went there, thinking that we would come back home in an hour or so, but we just couln't hold our horses after seeing the variety. The supervisior of the restaurant during our visit, was a really good host. He made sure that the dining experience was as smooth as it could be. We were looking for a dish like butter garlic prawns but it wasn't there in their buffet. Just so that we could have what we wanted to eat, the chef there made the arrangements to make this dish and then served it to us, going out of their way. Moreover, they had an exhaustive range of desserts during our recent visit. They had ice creams, mouth-watering halwa and many pastries. To talk about their staff, they were quite friendly and efficient. Overall, I would definitely recommend trying out this place as Taj will never let you down, and will always use your feedback to improve themselves.

Hope you find this review helpful.",5.0,,1
Syed Zuman Husain,"For first team Lunch in my new office, I suggested this place. The ambience was good and satisfying. The taste itself was not up to the mark. The food lacked warmness. Lady finger in particular, felt undercooked that day.",4.0,,1
Munish Rao,"A very classy nice restaurant. Warm welcoming staff. Food was okay. We expected dishes to be little different but, It tasted quite oily and doesn't seem to be fresh. Chicken was quite hard. Also, less options in vegetarian corner . Frankly speaking,  it was equal to any ordinary restaurant buffet experience but acc to price it was not up to the mark. There is a day and night difference in what food we eat in Vizag , Mumbai, Delhi Taj and this experience in Hyderabad Taj.",2.0,,1

Rukhsar Ahmed,"We went here for our anniversary dinner. The ambience was amazing as we got a table in the lawn area . Too soothing and peaceful.
The desserts were very scrumptious and personally me being a dessert lover, i couldn't get enough of it.
The food was a bit disappointing compared to the pricing and hype. Very little to choose from when there are numerous dishes served at other buffets. They should've included foods from different cuisines too.",3.0,,1

INTRO MUSIC,Great buffet spreads during lunch. Lots of variety to choose from. Particularly liked the dips and the hummus in the salad section. Pita breads weren't as good though. Pastas have to be made less saucy. But what really supercedes all this is the dessert section! They have outdone themselves in Indian and western desserts. The staff is very helpful too,5.0,,1
