Nikhilchakradhar Nekkalapu,"I've had lunch buffet at The Dining Room, and it was amazing.

Right from the front desk desk staff to the cleaning staff. Each one of them welcomed me with a smile. I really like when people greet with smile. Not just while greeting, even while clearing my plates, while serving food, and during taking down my order, they didn't miss a smile on their face. 5/5 for staff.

Buffet included North Indian, South Indian, European, Asian, Italian, Chaat and not to forget the amazing desserts.
I loved every item on the menu as they tasted amazing. I just can't mention 1 or 2 dishes as most of the dishes were amazing. 5/5 food.

Ambience was too good. 5/5 for atmosphere.",5.0,,1
K P,"I recently had the pleasure of enjoying the buffet lunch at Park Hyatt, and I must say it was a memorable dining experience with a mix of delightful surprises and a few minor disappointments.

The buffet spread, while not extensive, covered a wide variety of cuisines, offering a satisfying selection of dishes. One standout item that truly impressed was the Adrak Ghost Shorba, which was heavenly in flavor and undoubtedly a highlight of the meal.

The atmosphere at Park Hyatt's restaurant added to the charm of the dining experience. The cozy ambiance and the tasteful decor created a warm and inviting setting. The seating arrangements were comfortable, and the attention to detail in the decor, including elegant lighting and well-chosen furnishings, contributed to a relaxed and upscale dining environment.

However, it's worth noting that the live counters, including the soup kitchen, didn't quite live up to expectations. Live counters often add an interactive and engaging element to the dining experience, so it's unfortunate that these aspects fell short.

On the brighter side, the starters were a hit, with the mushroom dish being a standout favorite. The high quality and flavors of the starters were certainly praiseworthy.

The service experience was a mix of two sides. While the senior staff appeared somewhat aloof, the table wait staff was excellent and attentive, making sure our needs were promptly met. The chefs, too, played a pivotal role in enhancing the dining experience, creating memorable moments with their culinary expertise.

Lastly, the desserts were nothing short of fantastic. It's always wonderful when the sweet ending of a meal leaves a lasting impression, and this was undoubtedly the case at Park Hyatt. The dessert selection was a delightful treat for the taste buds.",5.0,,1
Himanshu Chandra,"Went for Dinner Buffet with family. The food was good, however, the service was not up to the mark. We had ordered dosas & pastas from the live counters, despite waiting for more than 1.5 hours, didn‚Äôt get any order served. At the live counter, they didn‚Äôt even bother to note down the order, whenever we reminded, the standard answer was ‚Äúwe are making other orders, you will get yours soon‚Äù, in the end, we didn‚Äôt get anything!

The people at the live counters were making the food so slowly and didn‚Äôt bother at all about service. Even the breads like Naan / Roti took a very long time to be served.

If you have live counters, please staff them properly! Secondly, being a vegetarian, found it quite disappointing that the Veg & Non-Veg Biryanis were put side by side with a shared spoon (noticed people using the same spoon for the veg & non-veg), Pasta section also, the spaghetti was overflowing into a tray with meat / seafood in it. These are basic things that one would expect a five star hotel to ensure / follow specially in India.",2.0,,1
Sam,"The moment I entered, the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff made me feel welcome. The menu featured a wide range of options, and each dish was a masterpiece of flavors and presentation. The Pan-Seared Scallops melted in my mouth, while the perfectly cooked Filet Mignon left me craving for more. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, guiding me through the menu with expertise. The attention to detail and the culinary skills of the chefs were evident in every bite. The Gourmet Corner is undoubtedly a hidden gem that I would gladly revisit.",5.0,,1
