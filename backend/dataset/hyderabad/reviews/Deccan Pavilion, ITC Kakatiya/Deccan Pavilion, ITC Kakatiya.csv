Mohit Gattu,"I was there with a friend on Sunday Oct 29th for dinner & drinks. There was a clear disconnect between the lobby manager or whoever it was we spoke to on the phone(Shoumita or Shubhomita), who told us (that the restaurant & bar) was open 24 hours and the host who sat us down, claimed that only select items were being served all day. We ordered a mutton biryani which was pretty average(much better biryani options are available outside). Shabby interiors and stained table napkins didn’t help at all! Definitely not the five star experience we were looking for! You can’t call this a restaurant inside a 5 star hotel!",1.0,,1
Chandan Shirbhayye,Visited Deccan Pavilion for breakfast on a business networking meeting. Spread of breakfast is decent and staff is very courteous. Place was crowded so had to wait for some time & can't have comfortable chat but that's understandable. Food taste was excellent especially the South Indian dishes. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit.,5.0,,1
Chan Prakash,"One of the best 5 star hotels in Hyderabad. The ambience was very good. The atmosphere is serene and it was pretty peaceful. Most of the items in the menu were good. Although, I felt the appam and biryani were not that good. Overall a good restaurant to visit for luxury south Indian dining experience.",4.0,,1
Shashank Devisetty,"Visited the Deccan Pavillion on a weekday night for a family dinner and the hospitality was simply reminiscing. The quality and taste of the food exceeded expectations and had value for money. However, there could've been much better varieties of food for both veg and non-veg starters. The main course unlike starters had abundant options and the taste was good as well. Tender and Juicy as required. Desserts were worth mentioning too",5.0,"Roasted Vegetables, Garlic Naan, Chocolate Cake",1
Rajeev Kumar Thukral,One of the finest South Indian restaurant in India. Deccan pavilion is situated inside the ITC Kakatiya hotel in Hyderabad. The restaurant is looks amazing from inside and serving is done on silver cutlery. They will offer unlimited food to a person and it’s tough to eat complete plate. This can be a good option for Brunch over the weekend #SouthIndian #Food #Hyderabad #Deccan #India,5.0,,1
