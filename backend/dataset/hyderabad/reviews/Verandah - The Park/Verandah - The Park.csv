Jedidya Ephraim,"We went to this restaurant as a family of 5 adults and 2 kids. We enjoyed the food, the ambience, the service and the atmosphere. The Bastar Chronicles food festival was the highlight, our parents reminisced about the food from Bastar in Chhattisgarh. Our kids got to run around the tables and ate to their tummies full. The dessert section was overloaded too.

Kid-friendliness: A lot of space for kids to run and enjoy the place.

Tripti KGolem,We were here for my sister‚Äôs birthday and we had a wonderful time. The consistency of food has definitely changed but not in a negative way. It‚Äôs just a little different but fresh. Extremely fresh and flavourful menu. Had some scrumptious food and drinks. Their salad spread was great. Highly recommended for family dinner.,5.0,,1

Barnali Dey,"Decent food, good ambience and the pool side view makes it one of decent option for lunch/dinner. Desert spread is good but would expect good spread of other main course as well. Would love it if they work on the taste wise quality of the food. Though it's a 5 star but day by day the maintenance is going on low side.",4.0,,1

MOHAN KUMAR,"Not worth at all, total waste.
We went for buffet here, and the food taste is ridiculous. All items were cold and some are not even edible.
They were charging for water as well which is ridiculous. Unless otherwise you have a huge discount on the bill, it‚Äôs not worth trying here.
Usually when we go to barbecue buffet, we‚Äôll at least like one item and we stick to it. But here none of them tastes good. Even ice cream is so salty.
Service is very bad, we have to keep asking them to bring this and that multiple times.
Don‚Äôt even dare to try schezwan chicken.
My bill amount for two is 2877 and I paid 1537 with Dineout, even then I feel like it‚Äôs not worth at all. Don‚Äôt waste your money here. I gave 2 star only for The Park, and Ambiance outside restaurant.",2.0,,-1
Praveen Bharatam,"I am specific about the new year event.
It's chaos. They were not able to manage crowd, the elevators were down due to heavy duty, management, security got confused the bands they had issued. It must have been organized a lot lot better. I would never go again to any events here.",1.0,,-1
Sridhar Gupta,"Really loved the place with beautiful side view of hussain sagar... The ambience and the hospitality of staff is very good.

Coming to the food.. It taste awesome started with soft drink.. Need to try the mocktail of Kiwi flavour... Crispy corn and pizza adding to it... Simply delicious..

Buffet with thier arrangements is so beautiful for eyesight...

All though its a fivestar hotel..

People who love taking photos selfies.. Benefit for u guys to capture much photos with a background..

Those who are fond of tollywood movies.. Can relate few scenes in this location..

Worth visiting the place for food, sight view and staffing response for their customers...",5.0,,1
Varun Kishore,Never! Never book Verandha (The park) for a party. I Reserved a table a day before on 17th Nov for around 9:30 for my mom and her friends/relatives who are all 55+... Got a call at 9 (30mins before we arrived) from them saying that they won‚Äôt be able to honour the reservation because they're completely full and we need to cancel the reservation. The guy on the phone was rude and showed little to no regret. We got no help from them he just said we need to cancel the reservation 30 mins before the party what do you do?  Mind you that this was a family get together and most of our family members live more than 25 - 35 mins away from this hotel so they were already on the way. All the members that were going to attend this party are also senior citizens who are 55+. What would you do in this situation? When your friends and relatives who are that old are put through this trauma. We had to call all of them and cancel the party because of them. Never book this place extremely rude and we don‚Äôt care kind of attitude/environment in service business.,1.0,,1
Sreenivasulu Meda,"This was another restaurant in my list. Finally, went for a dinner buffet. The review is for vegetarian buffet. Ambience is good. Customer service is also good. Coming to food, it is just ok. Nothing tasted great. The buffet contains only 2 starters, which is a downside for the price they charge.",3.0,,1

Vrutika Gandhi,Buffet experience is not up to the mark. Soup and starters are not heated properly. Less options in sbji/gravy and is very oily. All deserts with cinnamon powder tasted so bad..!! Only good part is salad/roasted veggies - perfectly cooked. Overall not recommended. Not much variety which is expected in buffet.,2.0,,1

Jay Prakash Nagari James,"Disappointingly Overpriced for Limited Variety

I recently dined at Verandah for their buffet, and I must say that my experience left much to be desired. While the ambiance was pleasant and the service was attentive, I couldn't help but feel let down by the exorbitant price tag attached to the limited spread they offered.

The initial excitement of indulging in an all-you-can-eat feast quickly waned as I surveyed the buffet tables. The selection was astonishingly limited, with only a handful of dishes available in each category. While I understand that quality often trumps quantity, the offerings fell short on both fronts. The appetizers lacked diversity, the main courses were meager, and the dessert section was disappointingly sparse.

What truly added to my disappointment was the pricing. For the steep price I paid, 6k for 2 adults and 1 seven year old kid, I had anticipated a wider variety of gourmet dishes to choose from. Instead, I found myself hesitating to refill my plate, fearing that I might not get my money's worth.

While some of the dishes were undoubtedly well-prepared, they simply couldn't compensate for the lack of options. Additionally, the absence of any unique or standout dishes further highlighted the scarcity of choices. In a culinary landscape where competition is fierce, one would expect a restaurant charging a premium to rise above the ordinary.

Ultimately, I left feeling unsatisfied and somewhat cheated by the experience. While the ambiance and service had their merits, they couldn't overshadow the fact that I had paid a hefty price for what felt like a glorified limited menu. I sincerely hope that the management takes customer feedback seriously and considers revamping their buffet spread to better justify the high cost.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a truly indulgent buffet experience with a wide variety of options, I would recommend exploring other dining establishments like Trident or
Marriott may have potential, but as it stands, the combination of limited variety and exorbitant pricing left me with a sour taste in my mouth.",1.0,,1
Alekh Andole,"A treat to endure at the five star restaurant.

You'll get Italian, continental, what not served professionally and deligent.

Try the buffet. Although it does make you find the stars while you pay the bill it does endure the quality you expect.

All time suggest for in and around Hyderabad.",4.0,,1
