Roma Mathur,This was one of the amazing expediences I have had. Beautiful place in the night.. The beautiful lights around.. The decor of blue looks amazing. Food and time with a good view was fun. The service was really good and quick. The drinks were really good.,4.0,,1
Surendra Rajendran,"Executive experience from unique perspective. Discuss in detail for corporate booking in detail on the pre-book amount else will be in trouble to reimburse later, they are not much help in sorting out the billing issue. Can visit for the novelty",4.0,,-1
G B,"Went for birthday dinner at Minar after an amazing corporate lunch free months back.

Total disappointment. Got stale food. Returned pappad and then got veg assorted kebab platter which was again stale.

The kitchen staff is reusing their old cooked dishes and not serving freshly prepared items. What a disappointing after spending so much. Might as well go to a nearby dhaba.

The ambience is great and the service is pretty good! Tipped the waiting staff separately. Not kid friendly which is one good thing unless you want loud screaming kids running around

Not coming back for food EVER!",1.0,,1
Praveena Injamuri,"Sheer luxury.

Food is great. Loved it.

I particularly enjoyed Marag with bread. It was divine.

One thing I didn't like is the wait time.
There is too much wait time between each serving. While the dish was already on the table, there was no one to serve it. This is unexpected when the USP is luxury itself.
There is a lot of wait time even for your order to come but that's alright as you might want to spend more time enjoying the ambience.",4.0,"Complementary Cake of the Day, Anokhi Kheer",1

Alex Oxley,"Specifically picked this venue as a birthday treat as its in a spectacular location and had good food reviews. It is all that, but boy-oh-boy everything else was a disaster!!
In summary:
1) Staff: Need training in what an ""exclusive customer experience"" is supposed to be like.
2) 2hrs for dinner if you arrive @19.30: Even arriving on time, with such an extensive menu and preparing the food and just chilling, 2 hrs is nothing! AND they tell you that you must leave by 21.30
3) Dress code: The staff totally ignored their own Web site. Apparently ripped jeans and sandals are perfectly acceptable.
4) Internet: For the love of money, please offer it to diners and allow them to share this exclusive experience there and then. Learn from far less exclusive restaurants !!

I recognise that Jewel of Nizam will have it's advocates, but our experience was at best very unfortunate, at worst bad!

If you want to read more then please do.

I saw Jewel of Nizam, Golkonda Resorts as an ""exclusive"" dining experience (in that it's circa 4x the normal meal prices in Hyderabad) & has a dress code (according to their web site), and of course the spectacular views!!.
Booked online and preferred the 19.30 dinner. No where on the web site does it say you have to ""vacate"" by 21.30 if you book the 19.30 slot. It feel like ""bums on seats"" are their priority.
Web site states ""Dinner 07.00 PM to 11.30PM"". Just 2 hrs really!!!
Email confirmation of deposit payment also states the same.

I wanted to email some pics, but, even though this venue is hugely expensive compared to the majority in Hyderabad, we were NOT ALLOWED to have internet access as we were not resident!!! REALLY GOLKONDA COME ON, EVEN KARACHI BAKERY OFFER INTERNET!!!
As soon as we finished our starters we were asked if we'd like to order mains, as we had to vacate by 21.30 - REALLY GOLKONDA, THIS IS AN EVENING RUINING STATEMENT.
We spoke to the manager who was apologetic about his staffs comments. Yep he should have been, a totally unacceptable way to try and promote what was supposed to be a wonderful customer experience.
The clock was ticking, so did we have time for mains and a desert - the answer was NO, we certainty didn't. So we just ordered a desert.
Then bewilderingly after ordering a desert with the manager, he offered us a small cake with ""Happy Birthday"" iced on it by way of apology for his staffs unsubtle way of telling us ""the clock was ticking"". WE HAD JUST HAD DESERT, AND WE'RE NOW OFFERED A CAKE!!!
Then a staff member wanted to take a photo ON HER own PHONE. ....errrr why!!
Dress code. According to Golkonda Resorts own Web site: Formal & semi-formal. Well that's totally ignored by the staff. Ripped jeans, sandals are apparently acceptable.
I've eaten all around the world, in exclusive and Chai shops, but i have never experienced a feeling like i was just ""cash in the bank"". Get them in, feed them asap, ship them out and get the next lot in. Food is great, BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SIMPLY DIRE!

Vegetarian options: This is India, so yes, load and loads to choose from.

Rahul T,"This place is for nizamsâ€¦ price is around â‚¹7000 approx per her head and you will be shocked to see how little they serve. Appetiser server
2 small prawns
2 fish fillets
2 chicken cubes
Some mutton raan
Followed by main course

Overall very pricey for the experience. I prefer Falaknuma palace over this.",3.0,,-1
SHANmugha kumar Velappan,"A very different experience of dining. You feel like a Nizam . The food is menu is set menu where you choose between 3 menus one is non veg with prawns,  non veg and veg .  Amicably a 5 course set meal . The food is very good but it's nit served hot.  Is at best Luke warm or not warm . I sincerely think if you catering a different experience of an awesome Nizam inspired atmosphere with a view with silverware and fine cutlery the food should also should match . Saying that nothing wring with food but certainty it can served at right temperature . Overall a very nice experience.",4.0,,1
Dhruv Sharma,A beautiful fine dine place within Golkunda Resort. A little out of the way. Getting return cabs from there might be time consuming. We spent that waiting time in exploring the resort. Good to go with family. The food preparation and portions were both superb. Service was prompt too. We went with prior booking.,5.0,,1
Vishwanath Singh,Decent food and service not worth the hype. Great place for sure.,4.0,,1
shikha rao,"It's an experience to relish. One needs to make advance reservations because the place has limited tables. They have options for set menu as well as ala carte. We chose set menu which was a relief because it eliminates the process of collecting preferences from each of the 8 member group.
They venue and minar are definitely beautiful. We requested for the lake facing table but lil did we know that the ac doens't work for that table and it gets hot. Unfortunately the staff was less than helpful in this regard.
We had fancy plate settings and cutlery and they started us off with our 5 course meal.

Their menu changes everyday apparently. But overall the experience for my family was great although some of the boomers in the family couldn't digest the pricing ðŸ˜‹",5.0,"Dal Makhni, Mutton Biryani, Kebabs",1
Venkatesh Gadam,"As one can imagine, this place is awesome. Kids and parents loved spending time in quiet and refreshing place. The ambience and the restaurant was great. We could spend hours here.

But..

Food was below average. Varieties more than 10 20 year old and taste was below standard.

All the best, I may come again after a long time if I see positive feedback from others.",2.0,,1
Harjot Kaur,"This place needs a pre booking, so make sure you make a booking on the call. Also, there's an assited parking. Yiu can experience a luxurious meal and the service is just way too good. Lovely place to be with your family and friends.

Do visit this place if you want to get a new experience and time away from your daily routine. You will love the ambiance and atmosphere of the place.

Good food good place and good taste.

Also, the service provided by the property is at its best. Loved the place truely.

Bhonsle Shalu,"Wanted to visit this place since long after the hype, the reviews, the reels and ytvideos. Nothing great. Worst part is they said they would only serve thali and ala carte option was not available. Food is bland without proper flavours. The cost of food is very expensive and it does not justify the food offered. Lake view was nice apart from that didn't enjoy anything about this place.",1.0,,1
Tripti KGolem,"Authentic Hyderabadi taste. Highly recommended to go for dinner if planning for a date or casual party. The only challenge is that they do not allow kids below 12 or 14 for dinner. So if you have little ones joining you, lunch should be your choice. ðŸ˜Š",5.0,"Apricot Pudding, Anokhi Kheer",1
apoorva patnaik,"Except for the ambience and looks, it is an over priced and over rated restaurant. For the amount they are charging(3500+taxes) per person they can serve amazing food, but still chose to serve routine kebabs and curries and biryani and 2 desserts which you can get unlimited at all the buffet places. Service is very slow.",2.0,"Apricot Pudding, Kebabs",1
Santosh,The ambience was fantastic. Food was delicious. Starters were decent. Biryani was aromatic and flavourful. Not ideal for large gatherings but a place to visit for sure.,5.0,,1
Vaibhav Kaushik,"I loved the place, the experience and the staff. However, if you are someone like me who likes spices and a strong flavour in food then you might not enjoy the food much due to it's plain and bland taste. Don't get me wrong, the food might be good for many people like for my Mom n Dad who prefer their food simple and subtle instead of strong flavours, it just wasn't for me.",3.0,Apricot Pudding,1
bala alagarsamy,"Great venue. Went with my colleagues from Hyderabad and on entering they gave us all a necklace of pearls.

Ordered from the set menu and the food was excellent. Waiters were always available for any requests, and service was perfect. Views are also amazing up high in the tower.

Hopefully I'll get a chance to do it again!!",5.0,,1
Anoop Govil,Starting from Resort entrance to entering in Restaurant was a good experience. Ambience was luxurious nd gives royal feeling inside and outside the restaurant. You will have to reserve a table well in advance from there website by paying cover charges of Rs1000/- per person which later will be adjusted in you bill. Staff services could have been better. Food taste was just okay for main course. Veg. Starters were good. Seems they don't have expertise in vegetarian cuisines. Not sure about non veg.,4.0,,1
