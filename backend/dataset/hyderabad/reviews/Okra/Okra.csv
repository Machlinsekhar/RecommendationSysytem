Sandeep Tangellapally,"We went for lunch buffet for our second marriage anniversary.  I wanted to talk about the atmosphere trust me it's worth visiting once if you are in Hyderabad, the place is so huge and well maintained. The staff is so grounded and knows how to talk to the customers properly and impress them. We were expecting the food section to be huge with a lot of varieties but it's normal and even the taste was normal but the deserts are very good. The reason we opted for this restaurant is It's a 5 star hotel in the city and the very old one. The price of the buffet is fine and we got a 50% GIRF deal in swiggy dineout.
The place is located exactly in the centre of the city with the best view of the hussian Sagar.",4.0,"Dessert Platter, Mutton Biryani, Cake Slice",1
Suxant,"This restaurant is located in the ground level of the Hyderabad Marriott hotel & convention centre. This is also the place where complimentary breakfast for the hotel guests are served. The ambiance of the place is great. It is also attached to the common swimming pool on one side of the restaurant. The prices are slightly expensive than the neighboring restaurant Bidri. Also the service at Bidri is better than this one. Found out that there is usually a delay in serving food once the order is placed. Even taste wise it could not match Bidri. Having said that, the experience was not that bad at the same time. There are a few evident areas for improvements. Currently there are discounts offered on dining for Zomato Pro/ Gold members. Overall, a decent experience.

Parking: Plenty of parking available",3.0,,1

Mahek Desai,"After the enchanting Christmas Tree Lighting at @marriotthyderabad , I was tempted to check out what the had to offer in their lavish Christmas Buffet feast.

And oh the spread! From mains to desserts, the options were plenty and delectable. Kids will have a ball around all their adorable Christmas-themed decor and I definitely did too.

AMIT DWIVEDI,"The restaurant is very beautiful with nice ambience and warm staff.

The Buffet Spread (starters) is good and nice variety . Options for vegetarian are few and that may be a deal breaker .

The Main course dinner spread is good and does live upto the std of the name. Overall a good place to have buffet delite for NV lovers .",4.0,,1
C.V. Rajendra,"A lot of spread compared to Momo cafe. Taste is what you expect from a 5 star hotel -- a bit mild on the spices. We had a birthday of our lil kid and they made special arrangements. Thanks, will be considering for another visit in future.",4.0,,1

sarat pavan,"Very very limited buffet spread for vegetarians..The desserts were very good and satisfying.
The service seems to  be the worst I have ever experienced in such a 5 star hotel. Looking at the service and hygiene level followed it really seemed to be below standards. Needs a lot of improvement in terms of service.
Also recommend increasing the vegetarian spread for the buffets.",3.0,,1
Chatpate_ log,"Had worst experience because of 2 things -
1. In papad, I saw a hair strand, which I didn't expected.
2. In buffet, a non veg item was LABELLED AS VEGETARIAN, like seriously?? What if a pure vegetarian person had ate it. I was saved because I had a doubt, but seriously this was not at all expected in such a 5 star hotel. How you can be so careless???

The place is having amazing interior and the staff is polite. In Veg buffet, we were served corn soup, 2 starters (paneer and potato), which tasted average and then we had alot of different items to eat like Greek salad, dahi vada, papads and a lot more.
For main course, they have a lot of options in curries like sahi paneer, potato curry, stuffed tomato, mixed veg, etc. But for breads we have to wait for a long time. The taste was good though.
Apart from these we had Chinese noodles, rice, biryani.. a lot varieties was available in desserts area but most of them were not vegetarian.

Hope they work on these areas, else they will loose customers.

Happy dining

Sagnik Modak,This pseudo-poolside restaurant is located inside the Mariott Bonvoy. The pool is on the other side of a glass panelled wall with one entry/exit glass door so you can view the pool without getting splashed on. This however also means you don't get to enjoy the pool breeze within the restaurant. But you can always bring your food outside and sit on one of the several couches surrounding the pool to enjoy the breeze. The prices are high as expected of a restaurant in a 5 star hotel but the taste and the service do match the price. I would recommend taking the buffet if you can and enjoy the most out of it.,5.0,,-1
Renu Rastogi,"Yesterday we planned Lunch in Badri but were disappointed that it opens for dinner only. So we settled for Okra buffet. Its was a disappointing fare in all respects..
Ambience is not at all like a five star hotel . Very normal sitting and nothing much to say about interior.
Service is just ok, they have heavy lids for all serving pots and no place to put them down then how to serve?
Vegetarian appetizers were very little just 2  and even those two were pineapple and mushroom
Main course is ok and so were the desserts, gajar halwa was so disappointing.. nothing like it should be. And no dry fruits or sauces to put on icecream.. only chocolate sauce and some butterscotch etc
In the end no saunf, pan anything",3.0,,-1
