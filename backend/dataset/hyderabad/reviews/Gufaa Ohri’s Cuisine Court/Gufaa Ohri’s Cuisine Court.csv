Asha Nair,"Gufaa Ohri's Cuisine Court is located in Basheerbagh. This is the first Ohri restaurant. Now they have a chain of restaurants. These are North Indian restaurants. Gufa is on the second floor. Lift facility is there. This is a junglee themed restaurant. The interiors are fashioned like a cave, and very dark. Only the table is lit up. Food is good. There are veg and non-veg dishes available. There is also a variety of icecreams to choose from. During peak hours, you will have to wait for some time to get a table.",4.0,Paneer Tikka,1
dhirendra jaiswal,"If you are a adventure lover and wanted to discover new theme and great ambience while having meal,Ohri's gufa is your destination. It has a great veriet of delicious cousins. The staff is good and quick in service. The manager is a very good person and he is very professional in his work. He advised for appropriate food and quantity as per guest number and age group. Quantity of food is sufficient in comprising with other restaurants. Atmosphere of gufa is ok but need some more improvement as per theme subject. Satisfaction is key for any business so the owner must ensure this tag line. Dk Jaiswal

Aishwarya Iyer,"Try the chole bhature here. And obviously, the Titanic icecream. Something i wouldn't suggest on your first visit is the crunchy bread rolls because it seems like just a fancier version of every other bread roll you get in bakeries. The customer service here is brilliant. They're super quick and really friendly and always have a smile on their face. Good place to have a quick talk too.
Wouldn't be a great place for professional meetups due to the dark ambience, but it isn't bad. It gives off a very calm vibe. I'm an introvert so it totally works.
Careful about the diabetes though ;)",5.0,Chole Bhature,1

Jonah Jagadeshan,"Gufaa is the first Ohri‚Äôs chain of restaurants in Hyderabad and it still hasn‚Äôt lost its sheen nor its loyal base. This place is old school, prices are reasonable and the service is really nice.

The whole Gufaa theme with Kaante Nahi Kat te types of music takes you back in time. It seems like they are stuck in the 90s.

Prashanth Kumar Ravikanti,"Captain Susanta, the pepper prawns I recently tried at Ohri's Gufaa were outstanding. The prawns were perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy, with a satisfying crunch. The black pepper sauce had just the right level of heat, adding a spicy kick without overwhelming the palate. The balance of flavors was spot-on, and the dish was beautifully presented. Kudos to you and your team at Ohri's Gufaa for delivering such a delightful culinary experience!",5.0,,1

Junaid Khan,Had a very pleasant dining experience here. The ambience and food is awesome. The service provided by Vijay is too good. He offered nice food suggestions and was quick to food serving. Overall great dinner outing,5.0,,1
Gautham Suk,"Food taste is good, but the quantity was huge. Tried all vegetarian items, like palak, mushroom and naan. Fried rice quantity was enough for 2 people easily. Meanwhile curries are served for 1. Don't understand that logic.  Make a note while ordering. Gufaa atmosphere is ok, it's dark and nicely air conditioned. Nothing particular special. No parking space in front, they have Valet Parking although.

Gadumur Mahesh,"Ambience is great feeling for first time goers. Food is average taste wise. Murgh Tikka is good with well cooked. Qurbani ka meetha is worst, we left it there. No ice cream in it. Lacha paratha was not at all good, it was thick and not roasted properly inside. Service is good. My friend liked the ambiance and it was memorable experience.",4.0,,1
Charan Shetty,Food was Good. Atmosphere fantastic. Services to customers were good but Waiting Time is an issue. Choices for both Veg and Non Veg is good but a bit on the higher end of pricing majorly due to the Ambience it creates. Overall a Nice Place üëç,4.0,,1

MUKESH PAL,"""At this restaurant, don't miss out on the flavorful Chole Bhature and indulge in the must-try Titanic ice cream. However, I'd advise skipping the crunchy bread rolls on your initial visit, as they might not stand out from typical bakery offerings. The customer service is outstanding, characterized by quick and friendly staff who always wear a smile. It's an ideal spot for a casual chat, though not the best choice for professional meetings due to the dark ambiance, which, despite not being optimal for formal gatherings, exudes a calm vibe - perfect for introverts. Just be cautious about diabetes, as some dishes may lean towards the sweeter side. Overall, this establishment offers a delightful experience, especially for those looking for a quick, enjoyable meal in a relaxed setting.""",5.0,Chole Bhature,1
