radhika d,Food was good. Served in the best way. I felt the quantity is too less for the price. It is like a train. Very nicely done.,4.0,,1
Yaksh Kishore,"Good place for some nice food. The options in the menu are good and the quality of the food is equally matched with the service.

The sad part of all is the presence of insects and bugs near the dining area inside the train bogi setup.

Half way through the meal seeing these on the table and running around the served dish was pathetic and had to leave the food there itself.

A restaurant charging such high pricing and with an ambiance like that didn't expect this kind of ignorance when it comes to hygienic.

Not going to visit this place again.",1.0,,1

Rupa Chowdhury,"The food is overpriced... Not so much tasty ...
The drinks have common ground not variety...all are sweets.

Srija Chimmani,"The ambience (train coach) reminds of a British colonial era which would strike the royal feels that of a King/Queen. The lighting is a little low(this one is for the photo people) and obviously perfect for couples. The main part that is the way food is presented is just wow, hospitality is great(they would explain every aspect of the menu in detail with a lot a patience) but taste isn't that satisfying, I would rate a 3.5/5 for food.",4.0,,1

Situated in a mall in Banjara Hills with hospitable hosts, unique ambiance, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation & wonderful dessert. I recommend to everyone!

Pranav Kumar,"This place is in the city centre mall. Parking a car is not a big problem but i would avoid the weekends.

Ambience is one of a kind. Apart from normal seating, there is a train theme which is awesome.
Table cloths could be slightly more clean but didnot bother me much.

Food is very tasty and menu is unique. Lot of items to choose from.

Staff is friendly and offer great hospitality.

Place is upscale, romantic, cozy and worth visiting.",5.0,,1
Vinayak Nair,"Great food, fantastic ambience. The food was served relatively fast and the flavours were amazing. The restaurant has a train themed section, which is very well made. It looks almost like the palace in wheels. People can also opt to sit out of the train section, say you are in a group and want everyone sitting together.",5.0,,1
Aamir Waseem Khan,"The restaurant is really good. Great ambiance and very cool place to hang around. The restaurant is given the look of a train coach. The food is delicious and lip smacking. Starters as well as the main course are great. Butter chicken, Paneer tikka, mutton seekh kebabs and mutton biryani are surely a must try. Do visit this place and enjoy the good food as well as the atmosphere and ambiance!",5.0,,1
Shubham Agarwal,"The review is more like 4.5 but didn't have an option. We being vegetarians, we're certainly not disappointed. The food was fresh and tasty. The ambience is one of it's kind and it was an experience to remember. Do give this place a try. PS they got their alcohol serving license revoked and hence no alcohol is available here.",4.0,,1

Mrityunjay Bhadauria,"One of the OG classic restaurants in Hyderabad situated on the 5th floor of the City center Mall on Banjara Hills.

The menu, staff and food taste has remained the same for the last 15yr or so, atleast since I started going there.

Ambience is top notch, you get to sit in a British era train coach and enjoy respectful and amiable service by the staff. Food is obviously the high point with limited options but top taste. Must visit if you are a regular or just a tourist in the city.",5.0,,1
Sreeja,"I highly recommend this place for families to experience royal retro train theme experience.
Food is totally worthy with the ambience.",4.0,,1
Ayaz Khan,Sit back and enjoy the vintage train ride. The colonial era themed restaurant gives you an enthralling experience. Even the finest details of the restaurant has the touch of British Raj. It is so hard to catch up with names on the menu book. But the service is excellent and they carefully explain each and every dish on the menu. Make sure you try the train coupe. A bit pricey but it's worth the experience. It's a must try in Hyderabad.,5.0,,1
