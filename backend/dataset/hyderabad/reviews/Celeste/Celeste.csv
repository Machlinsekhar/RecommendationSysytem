Bhairav Dalal,"2 days ago when we came here for dinner, it took them half an hour to get our falafel, today when we came here for breakfast, it took them 45 mins to get a paratha. The service here is as slow as it can be. Unless you plan on wasting 3 hours of your life on subpar food, I would not reccomend this place. In the words of a famous film star, their service was abysmal.",2.0,,-1
