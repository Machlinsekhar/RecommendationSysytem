Sree Ch,"This restaurant has exceptional food with a blend of Hyderabadi Nizam/Persian and Indian influences. We made a reservation ahead of time. When we entered the restaurant, the guy who we thought was the manager/head of service was rude and had an air of arrogance. The guy who served us (Chandan) was good, though.

The food deserves 100 stars as it's quite unique and delicious. The presentation was also very unique. I have never had any food that had similar taste profiles anywhere else in india before. We ordered a non-vegetarian thali, a vegetarian thali, and a mutton biryani. The meat was sumptuous - it was so tender and delicately spiced. The thali is very huge with lots of food, including a couple of starters. So, one needs to go very hungry to be able to finish the dishes. Some of the dishes had saffron, and they were so good. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Nizam food. We paid Rs.7500 for three people and think it's quote reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.",5.0,"Mutton Biryani, Tandoori Roti",1
Sonam Goyal,We reached early and without reservation. The staff was quite clear about timing and yet accommodating. The set course was good however service was a bit slow due to pre scheduled events. Food was decent.,4.0,,1

Dhirendra Kumar,"Considering how famous this name is, the food that we tried was good. There was a short wait time. Menu listing isnâ€™t too long though actual menu book is ðŸ˜„. Ambience was set as dim classy dinning. Still 4 stars because I travel a lot and I had experienced better ambience and food for what I paid. Recommended for non vegetarian peoples.",4.0,,1

neloufer ali,"So I ate the non veg platter worth ,2300 which was an amazing experience ,you will feel yourself to be a nawab for a day.

My family ordered other things and the bill came around 7000+ we forgot to use the dine out option to check if there was any discount.
My compliments to the chef everything they made wrt non veg the chicken curry,haleem and even the veg dal was amazing.
Loved how they gave the ghee and onions separately for haleem.
Amazing experience wrt taste of the food and the people who serve there also made sure that all of us on the table had food and no person had an empty plate.
Sweets were not so great but the rest of the main course had amazing taste.",4.0,"Mutton Biryani, Tandoori Roti",1
Murali krishna,We couple really had a good time at jewel of nizam. Food is awesome and very tasty.Service is excellent and Ali explained items and served us well. Only thing which I found little difficult is that back ground music is loud if possible try to reduce the volume. Overall great experience. Thank you,5.0,,1
Mansoor Alam,Truly a 5 star ambience and service. The biryani was authentic as well as other hyderabadi dishes. There was ample parking space too. A perfect place for family get togethers.,5.0,"Mutton Biryani, Haleem, Dum Biryani",1
Kalyan Reddy,"An Excellent ambience for which only we went nd the taste of the food is also good nd the price is high bcz of their ambience, receiving nd serving etc; which is a acceptable thing but the quantity is very less. Chicken Biryani which serves 2 stated by them, but it is full enough to only 1 person..  Here the Biryani costs Rs.885/- (including taxes as on 22-8-22). Apart from that place is very nice.

Parking: For cars the parking is good.. but for bikes an open soil parking..",4.0,,1
Deepika Rao,"We went for a family dinner with all the high hopes you have for a restaurant of this cadre. The food was great, as we expected. The service was fine. We found hair in our biryani, which is  something we didn't make a fuss about, because we do understand the realities of a kitchen.

When it was time for the payment, we wanted to split our bill among more than one card, as is the norm with a large group anywhere in the world now. But, they refused giving us a random explanation about it. The problem wasn't even this. When we called the manager to talk about this issue, he wouldn't even let us finish our sentence and kept talking over us.

This was not the kind of treatment you expect from a place like this. All they could do was be respectful and talk to their clientele.

And so, I am happy to rate it high for the food and the atmosphere, but the treatment metted out needs a lot of improvement.",3.0,,1
Beena P,"Food is good but not excellent. They charge you double compared  to other five star hotels, but then it's just a 3 star hotel.  Selling just because of name,  just worth a 2 star.we have paid around 9000/- of which foodwas worth a amount of 3000/-.  Not worth the money.",2.0,Mutton Biryani,1
sneha totloor,"To begin with, the decor and the vibe of the place was really good. BUT the service was TOOO slow, drinks alone came after 1 hour of ordering. Starters came later on. The desert we ordered was not at all well presented for the cost of it. Overall due to the service of the place itâ€™s not worth it for me. Even the quantity is VERY LESS!!!!",1.0,,-1
Ashish sirigiri,"Food is not great.
Mutton briyani is average, dont go on other ratings,
Ordered mocktails but they served in wishkey glass that was cheap although paid good price for moctails.
Ordered wine and they served it in some juice glass.
Waiters under skilled, as no proper serving ethics. ( served shorba hold dish by 5 fingers from above like local cafe)
Crockery looks old and patchy.

Management should work improving
Crockery, waiter serving skills and food",2.0,,1
jason sandeep,"Wonderful place To spend with your loved once, the starters were truly amazing.. the prawns and the chicken was so tender and juicy. Loved the ambiance and the staff. The service was little slow but the food was definitely worth the wait.",5.0,,1
Farheen Memon,"If you're okay waiting a bit, try this place! Overall a great experience, & perhaps the company I had was good- that made the food taste even betterðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜€ but worth trying. I tried the vegetarian, due to some confusion ALMOST ATE NON-VEG even though we reconfirmed and was claimed the food served is veg- they exchanged plates later- NOT REPLACED, which was fine since I wasn't there for business, I'm picky that way otherwise but servers are prone to errors and casually ignoring our comments. Oh! The bowl the soup was served was cracked too.",5.0,,1
Ramesh Kumar,Wonderful place out of town to enjoy a traditional food . Worth the money. In fact you should spend 2/3 night at the resort with your dear ones.,5.0,,1
Vaishnavi Sriram,"Went for the first time on a Monday evening, and I must admit the service was poor. We ordered the thali meals to taste all the hyderabadi food and the poor service diminished our experience.

The appetizer was v bad, the puff pastry was cold, dense and hard. The soup was good. The other vegetarian food was good and non-veg was not bad. The dessert though was not to good either.

Overall, if the service was better the overall experience would have been better. We had to wait a long time for each course to be brought out and for water to be brought out too.",1.0,,1
K T,Visited this restaurant for a celebration. Location is very easy to find. Restaurant is smaller with limited seating so it is better to call and reserve. Loved the veg options especially the veg dum Biryani. Starters are limited for vegetarians and the price is a bit expensive for the portion size. Overall I am very happy with the experience. Definitely recommend it if you are looking for a fine dining place which is not very expensive.,5.0,,1
