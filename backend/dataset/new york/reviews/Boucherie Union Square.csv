Jason Eng,"I‚Äôm enamored by this place. The service and ambiance is on point. I come here to sit at the bar, have a cocktail and a snack.

The last time I came, I thoroughly enjoyed the La Vie En Rose cocktail (so good it‚Äôs dangerous for your ‚Äúvie‚Äù) and the Boucherie Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e - a classic French dessert with a twist of black sesame - so good!! Special mention to the bread service too!

I also ordered the escargot (a standard for any French bistro), however I found it only fine‚Ä¶ not enough garlic or herbs for my liking I suppose.

Olga S,If your going during the Christmas season it's incredibly decorated. It's a great place for a get together with friends or a client. The food is delicious and no matter you select everything if a good choice. Just note that the dishes and drinks are a little expensive in relation to other restaurants.,4.0,"Creme Brulee, Duck Confit"

Pamela Darko,"The food was good, service at the bar superb. The hostess at the front not welcoming smile with a few eye rolls was so charming. I might strong on the ‚Äúmight‚Äù be back again due to the service at the bar alone. The brunch menu had more American food than french food thought that was odd. I‚Äôm in Paris/Versailles  often and I wanted something to remind me of there. The Brunch menu needs more authentic french options. I had the Champaign and Wagyu burger. Worth a try but not my first option for French food.",4.0,Wagyu Burger

Suzanne Corey,"This was a beautiful restaurant and the service was excellent! It was welcoming and friendly and the people made it a great experience for our family. They even brought us extra pommes frites for our little guy‚Äî so kind! The food is very good I think depending on what you order. Some items (the ribeye) aren‚Äôt quite worth being a $60 steak but I‚Äôd eat there again. The pommes frites were so good and the scallop dish was excellent!! I definitely recommend it!

Kid-friendliness: Very comfortable having young kids in this restaurant‚Äî (7 yo) They were welcoming!",5.0,"Boeuf Bourguignon, Pommes Frites, Escargots De Bourgogne"
Charlotte Miller,"Nice spot for brunch and if you're in the mood for French cuisine! My party of 6 waited about 10 minutes on a Thursday morning without a reservation, which is not bad considering how many other parties I saw waiting as well. All their items were delicious and filling, even if it may not look to big upon serving. I also got a hot cafe meal which is basically a latte with honey and cinnamon - would recommend this if you're looking for a twist on a traditional latte.",5.0,

Yana,"I recently visited this restaurant with a friend and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the bread with spread butter was delicious, and the lager was really great. The atmosphere and servers were also very nice.

However, I was disappointed with the orange duck I ordered. The meat was tough and chewy, and I couldn't even finish one piece of duck. The restaurant was kind enough to take it back to the kitchen, but I was already too discouraged to order another main course. Instead, we opted for the cr√®me br√ªl√©e for dessert, which was absolutely delicious.

Overall, while the service and ambiance were pleasant, my experience with the main course was not great. My friend tried to introduce me to French cuisine, but unfortunately, this particular restaurant did not leave a lasting impression.",3.0,

Rion Willard,"Authentic Parisian vibes, lovely gypsy jazz in the background, the interiors are stylish and we were given a lovely booth next to a charming piano - we really appreciated that as so many places are so noisy and this gave us privacy we enjoyed. Ibrahim our server was a true gentleman and our made dining experience fantastic. The food was fantastic, I enjoyed a wagyu burger and my wife had a juicy salad. Perfect evening! Will come again ! Thank you Ibrahim and the team at Boucherie.",5.0,Wagyu Burger
