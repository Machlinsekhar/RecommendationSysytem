Kaneez Abedi,"On Wednesday night i ordered this veg tawa pulao , cost was 250 and it turned out to be the worst. I went to take the home delivery by myself. Pulao was so spicy and the taste was very bad. I don't know what went wrong in making but this wasn't accepted.",2,,-1
Rahul Sonkar,"Visited rhis amazing mughlai cuisine restaurent with friends and it was totally amazing. Probably the best mughlai food place in navi mumbai. Must visit place. The ambiance is plus point for them as it is totally amazing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

We had chicken platter which was soo tasty and mouthwatering too. Along with that we tried bheja fry, mutton kheema and chicken kheema along with rumali roti. The taste was really amazing!!! Never had such tasty kheema ever. I am gonna definately visit here again.

In dessert we had kunafa, faluda and malpua which is their speciality. You must definately try their kunafa it is just wow. Yes wow is the word!!!

The staff was curtious and helpful. They suggestes and guided through every dish. The hygine was well maintained and the service was also fast. This place is usually packed so reservation is recc",5,,1

Kingshuk Mazumder,"It definitely goes by its reputation at the Best Meat Restaurant of Navi Mumbai. I was recommended by a friend and took my friends here for my Birthday and it was worth much more than what we paid.
The service was spot on and the people working in the restaurant were taking feedback after every dish. The decor was really impressive too. For sure a regular spot for me from now.",5,"Murgh Mussalam, Tandoori",1

Atul Salvi,"Food we order was mughlai Mutton Kepsa
It cost about 1950 rs taste was great, good quantity, 9-10 person can have one full Kepsa rice
Ambience needs to renovate.

Shailesh Warang,Overall it is a average eatery to taste Mughlai cuisine. We had ordered mutton dum biryani which ok..but the started mutton Bara was a disaster.  Unwarranted meat prices covered with spices..it was a the big turn off.. they have created shamiyana kind of sitting arrangement and interior is less illuminated. Vibes are little towards negative side.,3,,-1
P H,Has table seating for 10-11 ppl in booth type seating. Food is quite tasty and staff is prompt. Winter special paya soup was a revelation while chapli kabab was average. Persian thaal had decent sized portions though it was slight pricey imo,4,,1
Abhijeet Gite,"Ordered from swiggy, it was very bad experience. We found cockroach in egg biryani not sure why they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t maintain hygiene. Also taste of chicken biryani was very average not worth the ",1,,-1
R.v. Gowtham,"Food here is very delicious, traditional tastes of North Indian flavours. Chicken could've been slightly cooked better. Good ambiance for family too. Service is also friendly.",4,,1
Saurabh Singh,"It was one of the best place to have north Indian cuisine a year back but currently you will not find the same taste every time you visit you will find a different taste in the same order. I personally loved Ahmed bhai for the Biryanis but know i don't think that they have the same taste as before.
We tried :
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Chicken tandoori lollypop
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Paneer tikka masala with butter naan and roti

vishakha kasekar,The place is really good to hang out with friends and family. Ambience is really good and also the food. Lots of amazing food stuff is available. Non veg tasted nice. But the starters we ordered were not serve hot. And my friends even complained about mosquitoes. But overall I really like the place. More than the food I liked the ambience.,4,,1
Imran mirza,"This place is located is sector 21 , nerul, diagonally opposite to HDFC bank. There are 3 restaurants and I visited the one which has a cost personal setting. One table can accommodate atleast 8 to 9 people. Service is average, since it is a closed sitting and you don't get an opportunity to wave your hand and call the waiter and you will have to wait for someone to drop by. Coming to food we ordered for a Malai Tikka which was very sweet so it was just about ok. Foil chicken is a Chinese cuisine in red sauce and is something different and was good. Keema pulao was also good , however oil in it could have been a little less. Portions are enough to take care of 2 hungry men. Overall I would have rated 3.5 however since the option is not available I would rate 4 considering it has a very exhaustive menu.

PS: if the owner reads the review I would suggest a menu uploaded in a iPad or tab with direct order placing for the convenience of guests as well as the staff.",4,,0
Akash Poojari,"Aesthetically it has a royal look
The staff is prompt and kind but the waiting time is a bit longer once you order
Lets talk what i ate:-
MUTTON KHEPSA RICE :- This is the best in here you will get enough to fill four persons quantity wise as well as taste and quality wise
CHICKEN KHEPSA RICE :- This one is also too good to taste, so tasty that you won't stop eating even after you are full
CHICKEN PAHADI :- wasn't that extra ordinary but still good to taste
CHILLI CHICKEN :- This was good to taste and they also gave adequate quantity
CHICKEN TANDOORI :- The best starter here with enough quantity for 3 to fill with unbelievable awesome taste
If you look this resto aint much hygienic, infact i would suggest you to take a bislery instead of normal water
But other than that its totlly awesome",4,,1
Rohan Shingte,"I have been visiting Ahmed bhai past 10 years now..
Not even a single percent of quality in the dishes have changed....
Still the same. Still yummy.
I always prefer to have the same menu as the taste of it have been very well settled on my tongue.

1. Chicken patiyala
2. Rumali roti
3. Jeera rice.
4. Kala jamun to end the dinner.

Ask for dastarkhaana!

Just try it. Rest you can just blindly trust my review....",5,,1
Vishal Gupta,Guys don't go on menu uploaded here. Its outdated. The prices are double in real and the place is not worth at all. Neither atmosphere nor food. Not worth visiting. Be careful.,1,,-1
ROHIT PAWAR,"Well, if you are true non veg lover then this place is perfect for you.
Nice location, nice ambience, amazing tasty food, what else do you expect.
The restaurant has two different sitting locations nearby each other. One with a regular family restaurant sitting and other is with bit cosy, giving you tent sitting like feeling.
You can not bit taste of their food.
On weekends, this place becomes bit crowded and you need to wait anything between 15-30 mins outside.
Best place for food with friends, family.
It's bit pricey and service is also bit slow on busy days.
But overall amazing experience.
Try biryani, murg massalam and chicken Tandoori.",5,,1
Prasanna Vaidya,"We came here with high expectations this time. But it is not up to the mark as I had heard from a few of my references. We ordered mutton chap fry and it was quite oily. We did try rumali roti and gravy item, the same oilyness was very much there. Plus the bill was too expensive as compared to taste",2,,0
