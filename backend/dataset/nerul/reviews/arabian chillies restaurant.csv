We have ordered tandoori mix platter for Rs.1800 which has approx 32-35 pieces of chicken with different varieties like tandoori chicken, chicken seekh kebab, Chicken Tikka, Chicken malai tikka etc. This dish can serve approx 5-6 people.",5,"Chicken Tandoori, Tandoori",1

Abhishek Deshmukh,Nice food the taste was amazing and there was no rush in afternoon hrs ������ the service was also totally nice ���� but the roti we have order was butter roti and they have served different roti we have asked this is not butter roti but the staff have told this is butter roti only but on roti there was no butter so i don't think it was butter roti over all other food,4,"Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Crispy",1

Amaan Khan,"The food was delicious.
Crispy Bangkok was good.
Mutton chilli was amazing.
Chillies sizzler's chicken steak was juicy and really good, but the sizzler's noodles and rice were tasteless. Also we found an insect from the lettuce of the sizzler. But the staff was supportive and accepted the mistake and also waived the sizzler's price from the bill.
We eagerly wanted to try the prawns dish, but unfortunately it was not available.
Sweet lime juice was good.
Shezwan chutney was too runny, could have been thicker.
Overall the atmosphere was good.

kumar chaitanya,"A  restaurant with  more non-veg options. You can have  Mughlai, Chinese or Lebnani food. Service is slow and you have to wait for your order. Some veg options are also available. Service is average. Food is ok except for some non-veg items. Price is on the higher side as compared to  quality of food. Seating facilities are small and strangely curtain between tables. You have better options at the same price in the close by area.  You can visit once.   Staff are confused and service is slow and average
The ambiance is ok .  Test 3/5 , price 2/5 , Service 2/5  value for money 3/5 . Overall you have a better option available in Seawoods and close by are with lesser price.

Parking: You have to park on raod

Wheelchair accessibility: No",3,Chicken Afghani,1
Joe Francis,"The ambience of the place is very good. I loved the food as well. I had boneless murg musallam and wheat roti. My issue was that the chicken ���� was lesser than the gravy. Got very few pieces. Seemed like 1/4 chicken rest gravy. The price was not that cheap too ���495 for chicken and rest for roti all came up to ���672.

The service was very slow to. When I asked for extra roti that took a lott of time.

Overall look inside and out side was good. Also in the afternoon shwarma and Lebanese food was not available. The crowd was young when I went in. Few guys went behind the curtains ��������. C",4,Murgh Musallam,1
Vaibhavi Mirkute,"Non-vegetarian food is always a delicacy to have over here. The overall place is great, staff is quick and food presentation is nice.
.
They have a wide range of non-veg food to choose from and the restaurant has a great sitting area to enjoy your meals.
.
They have curtains for all the tables to maintain the privacy of all the customers and if you are someone who wants the curtains to be closed, you can tell them.
.
The food is little bit on the expensive side but can be a good option for one or two occasions (I wouldn't go there more than that). I didn't like the Shawarma that we had.",3,,1
Life of Shariq,"Visited Arabian Chillies today , ordered Lebanese Thaal. But it was not worth at all. Only pita Bread Kunafa & Roasted Chicken was average. Rice was totally tasteless. Masala papad is good ���� Some waiters are too arrogant and doesn���t replies when ",1,,-1
Rohan Shingte,"5 stars are for the Ambiance they have created.
Prices are too high.
You will have to inform them prior to not make dishes spicy if you don't like spicy food.
Main course we ordered was too spicy & my family could'nt enjoy much.

Let them know to make Chicken lollipop less crispy if you order or else you will not enjoy it. They make the very hard. Almost like hard papad.",5,,1
Honey Joshi,"Pathetic food ever tasted, kebabs were served within 5 minutes .
We tried mutton kabab- worst,chewy ,gazab ka tikka - marination was raw,
Hummus platter - too sweet chicken,
Chicken lollipop too oily.
Wish I could give minus rating.",1,,0
ayyub tisekar,Food quality and taste was not upto expectations. We tried shawarma which was a very big disappointment. Chicken lollypop was very hard to eat. Mutton rogan was also tasteless. Service was also not satisfactory. I hope they will improve their food quality and taste in future.,3,,-1
Aamir Shamsi,"Dishes are on the expensive side.
But as there are hardly any good resturant options around so prices are justified.
Ambience is Good, spacing should be improved.
Tried Chicken bomb, Hummas shawarma, Manchurian Fried rice.",4,"Chicken Shawarma, Chillies Special Soup, Chicken Crispy, Garlic Chicken, Fried Rice",1
