Alok Adi,Nice place to enjoy food and drinks! The food is very good. The drinks are okay. The options in non alcoholic beverages are limited. The sitting area is spacious when compared to other restaurants in Mumbai. It is located in a street around 10 mts from the main road. Overall a good place to enjoy lunch and drinks with friends!,4 stars,expensive,Cocktail bar
