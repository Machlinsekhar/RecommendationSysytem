Much preferred the Woodside Inn in Colaba as this lacked atmosphere. ï¿½",3 stars,expensive,asian restaurant
Dr Devina Medda,Anthony is a brilliant sever! Your staff is very good at service. Your hospitality etiquette is one that a lot of other corporate commercial brands could learn from. The burger festival has some really amazing burgers being sold. And the card you give is also cool. Buys you the loyalty of your client. Thank you.,4 stars,expensive,asian restaurant

Ashwini Menon,Cutting 1 star from the atmosphere only because the music was too loud - especially if you were to sit at a table very close to the music. Otherwise the food was very tasty.

Kailash Gandhi,Bad bad service at the bar. The manager whoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s name starts with ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and a bar tender screwed up.
