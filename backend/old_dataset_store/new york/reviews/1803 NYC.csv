Ramya Shenoy,"Great place to get Creole food. I had the vegan jambalaya and the jerk cauliflower tacos. My partner tried the jambalaya with chicken and sausage. The vegan jambalaya had pineapples and cashews which added a nice flavor to it. The tofu in the vegan jambalaya was the star! We also had the bread pudding for desert and I would definitely recommend it. Overall a great place for dinner.

Ted Weitz,"Transported straight to the heart of NOLA at 1803 NYC üé∑üç§‚ú®.

Delicious Creole-inspired flavors, top-notch cocktails, and a vibe that‚Äôs pure jazz. The low lights and the soft jazz music created a very romantic vibe. I can‚Äôt wait to explore more at this Tribeca gem! üåÉüé∂",5.0,
Brian Tran,"One of the best places in NYC for good food, good service and live music.
The charbroiled oysters were delicious, full of butter sauce on a bed of lettuce and bread. Excellent!
Gumbo was very good as well. The shrimp Po boy es good but could have more shrimps. The
The begnets we're good but it could be a bit lighter and fluffier.
Overall I've if the better modern Cajun food. Prices were reasonable.
There were outside seating and beautifully decorated restaurants. On the mezzanine is where a small band would play.
Protip. Weekends there is live music. Check with the restaurant for times. Reservations are needed. It's busy. We went late lunch after 2.30pm and there was no waiting.",5.0,
Albert Wang,"Dropped by on a whim the other day. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, service and the overall ambience.

We ended up sharing a tuna nicoise salad and a rack of baby back ribs between two. The ribs came with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw. The amount of food was more than enough for two.

The highlights for me was definitely the mac and cheese and coleslaw. The ribs were still good, but the sides were GREAT.

Service was good, no-nonsense. Atmosphere was nice with a live jazz band.

I'd definitely recommend anyone looking for a good feed and good vibes to drop by.",5.0,
Tamiko Ramirez,I don‚Äôt know where to begin on how wonderful my friends and I ate at this restaurant. We seriously underestimated how great this restaurant turned out. Everything we had from the drinks to dessert was extremely delicious. My friend ordered the Hurricane. He liked it very much. I ordered the Summer Sangria. It was very yummy. My other close friend ordered the Purple Reign. She liked it so much that she ordered it a second time. Then came the appetizers. Honestly I‚Äôve never had Creole food so I was really excited to try it and my anticipation paid off. My friend ordered the Gumbo. We all completely fell in love with it. We literally fighting each other for the shrimp. Lol! The Gumbo was so good that I ordered a second plate to take home. I ordered the Jambalaya. Seeing that it was my first time trying it I really enjoyed it. My friend ordered the XO noodles. He really liked it. My other friend ordered the Bouillabaisse. She savored it. She loved dipping her bread into the sauce. I noticed how generous the portions are. The Gumbo can be a meal in itself. We all took our leftovers home with us. For dessert we ordered the beignets and the bread pudding. We all agreed the bread was the hit of the entire meal. It was so delicious! Our server was extremely nice and attentive to us. I can go on and on of all the great things about this restaurant. I can‚Äôt recommend this restaurant highly enough. Everyone should experience it for themselves.,5.0,

Madhu Shree,"Great place for a date night or friends & family special dinners. I have celebrated my birthday and special occasions with friends here. This is my third time at 1803 and this place still is the best. I have tried pretty much everything of their dinner menu and they really serve comforting, flavorful and delicious food.",5.0,

I‚Äôm a bit particular when it comes to NOLA restaurants in NYC. I have been searching for a charbroiled oyster that tastes exactly like New Orleans for the last 6 years. I‚Äôve been close to finding a spot in LES, but the price was outrageous.

I‚Äôve been here at night for a drink and it‚Äôs very lively and cute. Coming back for food at lunchtime was a bit of a different experience.

In my opinion, the Mac and cheese was not seasoned well. Had a nice little kick, but def needed some salt and pepper and maybe old bay ü§î didn‚Äôt love it, didn‚Äôt hate it.

The charbroiled oysters were good. The seasoning was very good! That said, they could have been broiled a bit more. It was missing the char taste I‚Äôve been longing for.

If you haven‚Äôt been to New Orleans these are very good. If you have, they‚Äôre still good, but they are not it. The space is soo pretty and I feel like this is a great spot to hang with a group of friends. Not sure if the pricing is worth it to me, but I can see why it‚Äôs crowded with tourists.",4.0,
Alessandra Distefano,"Really good late night restaurant. Quick service and nice atmosphere. The food was delicious. We got two steaks, the shrimp tacos and the rice with shrimps and chicken. Highly recommended if you‚Äôre visiting the World Trade Center in the evening and want a late bite. There is an outdoor space as well.",5.0,
Ellen Huang,"Recently came here for brunch. We ordered the signature gumbo (flavourful, but came with too much soup and not enough rice in my opinion) and the jambalaya (decent as well, although I wish its flavour were a bit stronger/sharper). Overall I liked the food, but I wasn't blown away, and I thought the prices were a bit steep.

Other than the food, I liked how the dining environment was open and well-lit. I also enjoyed the live music performed by the talented band. While I really liked the music, I will say it was a bit loud, and made it hard to hear people/hold a conversation.",4.0,
Najib Ahmed Soomro,"""I recently had the pleasure of dining at this wonderful restaurant, and it exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The ambiance was cozy, and the soft lighting created a relaxing and intimate dining experience.

The menu offered a delightful array of options, catering to a variety of tastes and dietary preferences. The food was nothing short of exceptional. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients that burst with flavor. From the appetizers to the main course and desserts, every bite was a delight to the senses.

The service was impeccable. The staff members were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was exceptional, offering insightful recommendations and accommodating any special requests I had. Their professionalism and genuine warmth made me feel like a valued guest throughout the evening.

In addition to the fantastic food and service, the attention to detail in the presentation of each dish was impressive. Every plate was beautifully arranged, showcasing the chef's artistic touch. It was evident that they took great pride in their craft.

The restaurant's commitment to creating a memorable dining experience extended beyond the food and service. The ambiance was enhanced by tasteful background music, and the overall atmosphere was lively yet comfortable, making it the perfect place to enjoy a meal and create lasting memories.

I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a truly exceptional dining experience. Whether it's a special occasion or a casual meal with friends or loved ones, this restaurant will surely leave you satisfied and wanting to return for more. I can't wait to visit again and indulge in their culinary delights.""",5.0,
Ian Van der Werff,"Great New Orleans inspired restaurant with an excellent brunch on weekends. Live music accompanies most brunch times (mostly jazz but with a smattering of other acoustic sets), great atmosphere and big windows to watch what‚Äôs going on outside. Also have a great outdoor eating space. Good cocktails (Bloody Mary is a favorite). Definitely recommend the Gumbo!",4.0,

Mitch Akers,Came here for drinks before going to dinner and our bartender made the best Old Fashioned I‚Äôve had ever! Wished the speakeasy would have been open but grabbing drinks here was worth it not being open.,5.0,
Z S,"Came the first time and liked it but that was a year ago. Wanted to come back and try it again but everything was different. The food, the ambiance, the music and the service. I was very excited about their biscuits which I had before and made me want to come back.
However, they decided to put cold toast as replacement instead of letting us know they didn't have biscuits and give another option to choose from... when we asked the waitress about it, she never came back to follow up. Food was overall really just ok and honestly not worth the price even in NYC",2.0,
Ross Todd,"Fried oysters 10/10
Corn Salad-let the chef know he out did himself. So perfect.
Jambalaya- wow I‚Äôm from Charleston, SC, but that will put some real south in yo mouth
Pecans and String beans! No she better don‚Äôt, never would have thought of it.

Had a nonalcoholic beer I have never heard of before, and it was awesome.

Atmosphere, calm, cute, sat out doors, relaxing perfect day

Maria, our server. What an angel. Paid close attention without hovering. Will recommend and return. Thank you.",5.0,
Marica -,"A short walk from the Oculus is a 1803 NYC ( Creole Style Restaurant), a not so hidden gem, but it was my first time there. Due train delays we were late for our 1p reservation(1:31p). The hostess told us our reservation was canceled after 30 minutes, and our options were to sit at the bar or outside even though it was not very busy. We opted for the bar, and it was the best decision because the bartender ERIC (A+ service)was phenomenal. He was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and made great drinks. The brunch menu was soild with great pitcher drink options ( BE CAREFUL WITH THAT ""FRENCH 75""   ), the shucked ostyer were fresh and delicious, the Jambalaya was good too. The Crawfish Cake Benedict was ok it had a good amount of oil soaked into the patties, but the eggs and hollandaise sauce were perfect. The home fries were cooked but lacked the fried exterior that I normally expect with home fries. There was a live jazz band play, and Eric also let us know that there is a ""Speak-Easy"" during the week....will definitely be going back for that!!! It's definitely worth the time if you are in the area!!",4.0,
Neha Luthra,I was really excited to try this place out. But I think the space is kind of outdated and it‚Äôs so small so it gets really loud and you can hear each others conversations. The food was also pretty bland and not exciting. The overall experience wasn‚Äôt amazing but it‚Äôs still doable to check out.,3.0,
Rits M,"my mother and I came here for lunch after riding the vintage holiday train. They let us into the bar because it was really crazy packed on a Sunday afternoon. They were nice enough to also, let us put our names down for the table and then they moved us to the table as soon as our meal came.

It is a New Orleans style restaurant, with a balcony up top and they play live music on Sundays. They have Lots of smaller tables surrounding a bigger bar. I think the largest table I saw sat six people. You do require reservations to come here so keep that in mind. You can also sit on the top balcony as well. It‚Äôs a good spot for people watching. The place is really bright and happy. I love the pink and green colors across the walls and it does feel like you are in New Orleans.

We tried the gumbo which was excellent and a large portion, the jambalaya which is really meant for 2 and the bread pudding which comes with an outstanding salted caramel ice cream. For drinks we had the all or nothing and it was pretty strong! All the food tasted authentically creole and was super delicious. Come with a large appetite! The whole meal with tip was $100 for 2 people. I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back :)",5.0,
