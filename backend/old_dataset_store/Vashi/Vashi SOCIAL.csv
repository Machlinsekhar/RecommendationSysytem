raksha Devadiga,Social has always been a favorite hangout. Food here is amazing. Visited Vashi Social for the 1st time. Food was lip-smackingly delicious and the music just gives you the right vibe.

Shreyashi Mukhopadhay,Went here for a dinner. We sat outside. The stand fan they are using did not make the sitting comfortable. Was feeling hot. May be next time we won't be sitting outside during Summers. But other than that food was really good. Staff seemed little overloaded so they could not explain the dishes to us. So we did not explore much.,4 stars,expensive,Restaurant
