Suraj Nair,Its an absolute heaven for vegetaraian food lovers. The place is mostly crowded so parking is very hectic in the area. The special thali os a must try in this place. Also if you are ordering a dal there is no need for any side dish such as roti or rice you can simply have it alone.,5 stars,expensive,Vegetarian restaurant
Kshitiz Gupta,We had opted for Special Thali which was tasty for 280rs. The buttermilk bottle which makes 4 glasses is thick and tasty for 125rs. The chapati are soft and filled with ghee.

Ravi Negi,Just one word itâ€™s overhyped and over proced. A normal thali and a special thali and one bottle of buttermilk costed 1000 rs. Sabji was too hot that it burned my mouth probably due to microwave. Staff wasnâ€™t much polite either but ok ok. â€¦,2 stars,expensive,Vegetarian restaurant
