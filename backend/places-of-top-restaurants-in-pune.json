From the moment I stepped into the elegant dining space, I knew I was in for a treat. They usually serve the buffet at their rooftop restaurant of It s Mirchi, however it is closed due to monsoon. Ambiance and Atmosphere The ambiance of the restaurant was a harmonious blend of sophistication and comfort. Soft lighting, tasteful decor, and cozy seating arrangements set the stage for a relaxing and enjoyable meal. The restaurants atmosphere struck a perfect balance between upscale dining and a welcoming, laid-back environment. Variety and Presentation The buffet spread was an absolute feast for the senses. The sheer variety of dishes on offer was awe-inspiring, catering to a wide range of palates and dietary preferences. From starters with flavourful deliciousness to succulent main course cooked to perfection, every dish was a work of art. The presentation of each item was meticulous, showcasing the culinary expertise of the kitchen staff. Quality of Food The quality of the food exceeded all expectations. Each dish was crafted with care and attention to detail, evident in the explosion of flavours with every bite. My friends enjoyed the seafood that was incredibly fresh, the chicken tender, and I had enjoyed the vegetarian options which were just as delightful. It was evident that the chefs take immense pride in their creations, as the flavours were bold, well-balanced, and left an unforgettable impression. Service The service provided by the restaurant staff was impeccable. Attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, they went above and beyond to ensure that every diners needs were met. Empty plates were promptly cleared, new food was served properly, and any inquiries about the dishes were met with enthusiasm. The seamless service added to the overall positive experience of the buffet. Value for Money Considering the exceptional quality, variety, and service provided, the buffet at was undoubtedly a remarkable value for money. The experience felt like a culinary journey around the world, and the reasonable price for such a lavish spread was truly commendable. In conclusion, my visit to the restaurant at Ramee Grand for their buffet was an unforgettable gastronomic adventure. The combination of a welcoming ambiance, an array of delectable dishes, top-notch service, and excellent value for money made it a dining experience I wont soon forget. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to fellow food enthusiasts and anyone looking for a culinary escape that tantalizes the taste buds and warms the heart. I look forward to returning to for another delightful buffet in the near future. Kudos to the entire team for creating such an exceptional dining experience!",

The food -- great variety and decent taste. The food wasnt something completely outwordly but I believe that to be good, sorely because, five star retaurants are notorious for turning common delicacies into something not so delectable, and I admire the effort made to serve good looking food and good taste. The ambience -- One of the main things that seperates the Taj from any other place is the iconic and calming fragrance that greet you upon entry. Adding to that, Blue diamond has great architecture and a very warm staff keeping you company throughout your experience. The service-- The service was welcoming and precise. Enough to know exactly what is happening at your table and what needs attention but not bothering or intruding your experience. Would definitely go again",
